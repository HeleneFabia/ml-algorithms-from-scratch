# Project #4: Building Machine Learning algorithms from scratch 


This repository includes several notebooks in which I built several different ML algorithms with NumPy, including: 

- Linear Regression:
  - one variable (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/1-linear-regression.ipynb">Notebook 1</a>)
  - multiple variables (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/1-linear-regression.ipynb">Notebook 1</a>)
  - features normalization (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/1-linear-regression.ipynb">Notebook 1</a>)
  - regularization (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/5-regularized-linear-regression%2Bbias-variance.ipynb">Notebook 5</a>)
- Logistic Regression
  - binary classes (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/2-logistic-regression.ipynb">Notebook 2</a>)
  - multi-class classification (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/3-multi-class-classification%2Bneural-networks.ipynb">Notebook 3</a>)
  - regularization (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/2-logistic-regression.ipynb">Notebook 2</a>)
- Neural Networks (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/3-multi-class-classification%2Bneural-networks.ipynb">Notebook 3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/4-neural-networks.ipynb">Notebook 4</a>)
- Support Vector Machines (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/6-support-vector-machines.ipynb">Notebook 6</a>)
- K-means Clustering (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/7-k-means-clustering%2Bprincipal-component-analysis.ipynb">Notebook 7</a>)
- Principal Component Analysis (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/7-k-means-clustering%2Bprincipal-component-analysis.ipynb">Notebook 7</a>)
- Anomaly Detection (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/8-anomaly-detection%2Brecommender-system.ipynb">Notebook 8</a>)
- Recommender Systems (<a href="https://github.com/HeleneFabia/ml-algorithms-from-scratch/blob/master/8-anomaly-detection%2Brecommender-system.ipynb">Notebook 8</a>)


These notebooks are assignments that form part of the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?#about">Machine Learning by Andrew Ng</a>, which I concluded in July, 2020. While the notebooks already included some instructions, formulae and code, the code I wrote myself can be found after the following line in each code cell: 

==================== YOUR CODE HERE ====================


Completing the assignments was a steep learning curve for me, since I thoroughly engaged with different machine learning algorithms. I did so by converting the theoretical concepts of the course mentioned above into code without using any already existing machine learning libraries. This also allowed me to strengthen my NumPy and Linear Algebra skills, as well as to practice looking for help and guidance whenever I got stuck with an exercise. 

Thank you to Gerges Dib for providing <a href="https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments">the course assignments in Python</a>
