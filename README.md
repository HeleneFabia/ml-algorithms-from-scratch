# Project #4: Building Machine Learning algorithms from scratch with NumPy 

This repository includes several notebooks in which I built several different ML algorithms from scratch with NumPy, including: 
- Linear Regression with one/multiple variables
- Regularized Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression with two/multiple classes
- Regularized Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

These notebooks are assignments that form part of the course Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, which I concluded in Augsut, 2020 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?#about)
