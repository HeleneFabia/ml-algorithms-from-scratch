# Project #4: Building Machine Learning algorithms from scratch 

This repository includes several notebooks in which I built several different ML algorithms from scratch with NumPy, including: 
- Linear Regression:
  - with one varibale
  - with multiple variables
  - regularization
  - normalization
- Logistic Regression
  - binary classes
  - multi-class classification
  - regularization
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

These notebooks are assignments that form part of the course Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, which I concluded in Augsut, 2020. While the notebooks already included some instructions, formulae and code, the code I wrote myself can be found after the following line in each code cell:
